BG Image Formatter
==================

This module provides an image formatter that allows you to set an image in background of a tag.
The images are from a field of an entity and not from a configuration page or a custom entity or something else, so it's
very easy to setup and manage.

It contains a submodule to handle responsive images as well.

Use cases
* You want to display a image on the back of a div when viewing a particular node.
* You want to display a random image on the back of a div on the frontpage only.
  This can be done using Views.
  Create a block, select the "Background Image" formatter for your image field, save, place the block, done.
